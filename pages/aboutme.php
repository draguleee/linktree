        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! I’m Andreea Ioana Dragu - or short, Andre — a passionate and curious 
            person who thrives at the intersection of technology, creativity, and 
            human-centered problem-solving. With a background in Software QA Testing, 
            I enjoy building meaningful digital experiences that make a difference. I also
            have a knack for software development with .NET, which allows me to bring idead
            to life through code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently working at Endava, where I collaborate with cross-functional teams 
            to deliver innovative solutions for clients around the world. I value clarity, 
            collaboration, and continuous learning, and I bring those principles into 
            everything I do; whether it’s developing intuitive products, streamlining 
            processes, or exploring the latest trends in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I’m a lifelong learner and an avid gamer. I have a deep 
            curiosity about how things work; whether it's the mechanics of a new game, 
            the design behind intuitive user interfaces, or the psychology of decision-making. 
            I’m always exploring new topics, reading, or taking online courses to expand my 
            knowledge beyond my professional role. <br>
            Gaming, for me, is more than just a hobby; it’s a way to unwind, connect with 
            others, and appreciate storytelling, strategy, and immersive world-building. 
            From competitive multiplayer sessions to narrative-driven adventures, I enjoy the 
            diversity and creativity that gaming offers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is a space for me to share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, 
            and the things that inspire me. 
        </p>
